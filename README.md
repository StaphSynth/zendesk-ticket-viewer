# README
A Rails App for viewing customer support tickets. The App requests tickets from the [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) Ticket API and displays them to the user. It pages through the ticket list 25 at a time, using the API's pagination support. The user can click on a ticket in the list to see it in more detail.

This branch is experimental. I'm just learning to use ReactJS and playing around with using the Rails app to throw JSON at the front end React app. If you want to see the Ticket viewer actually working as intended, go to the [master branch](https://github.com/StaphSynth/zendesk-ticket-viewer/tree/master) and follow the build instructions.
